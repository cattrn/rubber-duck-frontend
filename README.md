# Rubber Duck!!!

## Description

A simple web app for developers (or anyone really) to talk to a digital rubber duck and help them get unstuck with their problems.

## Development

The only pre-requisite at the moment is [Node & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

1. Clone this repo

   `git clone https://github.com/cattrn/rubber-duck-frontend.git`

2. Install dependencies

   `npm install`

3. There are currently no environment variables, so to run in development:

   `npm run dev`

This will start the server on port 3000.
